=== Flying Enemy ideas ===
* They don't have to move, they could be static and turn to look at you
* Roll ability becomes very important here (we'll need to teach it - roll under stuff?)
* Landing a hit on an enemy in the air should nudge the player up

=== Slam attack ===
if attack button is held while in air after first attack, do slam attack, bringing enemies down with youd

=== Bugs ===
* Can pick up stims after falling asleep
* Little black pixel on player
* Player can sometimes bounce a little when landing
* Camera behaves strangely on the left side of the map
* Animation glitch when player falls asleep
* Ordering issues between animated game sprites
